# 🧠 Real-Time Face Detection using YOLO and OpenCV

This project implements a real-time **face detection system** using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection algorithm along with **OpenCV**. It efficiently detects human faces in live webcam feeds or video files with high speed and accuracy.

## 📌 Features

- ⚡ Real-time face detection
- 🎯 Accurate bounding boxes using YOLOv4/YOLOv5
- 🎥 Works with webcam and video files
- 🧰 Built using Python and OpenCV
- 🧠 Optimized with Non-Max Suppression and confidence thresholding
- 🔍 Easy to customize for other object classes or models

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- YOLOv4 / YOLOv5  
- NumPy  
- Pre-trained YOLO weights and configuration files

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
